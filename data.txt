Write a short story about a child who visits the Ganges River for the first time.

Riya, a ten-year-old girl who lived in a bustling city, was visiting her grandparents who lived near the Ganges River. The wide, flowing river was unlike anything she had ever seen. She watched in awe as boats glided across the water, their colorful sails catching the sunlight. The air was filled with the sounds of clanging bells from a nearby temple and the excited chatter of people bathing in the shallows. Riya dipped her toes in the cool water, a shiver running down her spine. Her grandmother explained the importance of the river in their culture and the stories and myths surrounding it. As the sun began to set, painting the sky with vibrant hues, Riya knew this was a sight and experience she would never forget.

The Ganges Guardian would be a solar-powered boat equipped with giant nets to collect trash and debris floating on the surface. It would also have built-in filters to remove pollutants and tiny particles from the water. The Ganges Guardian would be programmed to navigate the river autonomously, patrolling designated areas and returning to shore to unload its collected waste for proper disposal.
